## Introduction

This Android app demonstrate how to make api calling alongwith saving data into database. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture pattern for better separation of concerns and uses Coroutines for asynchronous programming. Retrofit is utilized for making network requests, and Room Database provides local storage capabilities. LiveData is employed for observing data changes and ViewBinding for efficient view management.
